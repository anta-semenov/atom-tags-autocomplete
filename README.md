# tsx-tags-autocomplete package

Package suggest autocompletion for tags for tsx syntax (typescript). Inspired by jsx tag closer in language-babel package.

This part is missing in atom-typescript package.

Using tags autoclose packages doesn't convenient because they trying to 'close' typescripts generic syntax.
